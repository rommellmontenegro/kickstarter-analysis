# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
    *The dataset was scraped from Kickstarter.com to provide an opportunity to do some basic excel analysis with formulas that were then used to create line charts.
    *The data we used included the following variables: Launch Date, Parent Category, Subcategory, Goals, Number Successful, Number Failed, Number Canceled,
    Total Projects, Percentage Successful, Percentage Failed, and Percentage Canceled.

## Purpose
    *This basic analysis allows a student to practice their excel pivot table skills and to start programming by employing multiple basic filters to look at the
    number of plays that successfully or unsuccessfully achieved their fundraising goals.

## Analysis and Challenge
    *The only challenge I encountered was that I needed to turn off all wireless and wired network/Bluetooth connections in order for Excel to work, at all.
    I believe Excel's telemetric functionality was remotely used to impede my progress on this assignment.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    *The greatest number of successful theatre kickstarters occurred in May and June.
    *During any given month, more projects succeeded than failed.
    *October was the month with the most failed projects.
    *After May theatre kickstarter projects become successively less successful for the rest of the year.
    *A few projects (<7) throughout the year were cancelled every month.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    *The greatest percentage of successful play kickstarters occurred had goals to raise less than 15K or between 35K to 45K.
    *The greatest percentage of failed play kickstarters occurred had goals to raise more than 45K or between 20K to 35K.
    *50% of play kickstarters that tried to raise 40K to 45K were either failed or canceled kickstarters.

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    *The only challenge I encountered was that I needed to turn off all wireless and wired network/Bluetooth connections in order for Excel to work, at all.
    I believe Excel's telemetric functionality was remotely used to impede my progress on this assignment.

## Results
1) What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    *There certainly are times of the year, Spring and Summer, when theatre kickstarters are more or less successful.

2) What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    *There are certain goal levels that play kickstarters are more or less able to successfully raise.

3) What are some limitations of this dataset?
    *The data for each campaign reflects an aggregate of what was raised for each kickstarter project. We can't tell how much any given backer gave a kickstarter
    program. With this level of granularity, we could figure out how much any given category or subcategory of kickstarter campaign should target as a funding level.
    *No geographic or demographic information was provided to better understand in which regions supporters live or if there are certain characteristics like income,
    age, gender, employment, or education level to better target backers for a given kickstarter campaign.

4) What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    Other possible charts include:
    *The percentage of goal actually raised by kickstarter parent category or subcategory.
    *The average number of backers per kickstarter parent category or subcategory.
    *The average amount pledged per backer per kickstarter parent category or subcategory.
    *The average length of campaign per kickstarter parent category or subcategory.
